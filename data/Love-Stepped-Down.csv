"Herald, herald,"
"A Child who shoulders an enormous responsibility"
"Of illuminating our darkness"
"Of bringing joy to our dreary world"
"Of reconciling the prodigals to the One"
"Of teaching our stoppered hearts to ring again"
"Today, the reds we see tell of redemption - a love story!"
"The greens we embrace tell of life eternal - a true gift!!"
""
"How loudly this Child's birth pounds on every heart"
"This is the sound we respond to with reckless abandon"
"To give as we were given"
"To love as we are loved"
"To proclaim the Christ - King of righteousness!!"
""
"The crevices of our hearts yearned for You"
"Long before we knew Your significance"
"Light years before our fathers were conceived"
"Donkey years before our fathers' fathers were,"
"You planned it all carefully"
""
"Ye, again I say ye"
""
"? A child was born"
"The foundation for my redemption laid"
"Little Jesus, a KING born in a manger"
""
"? A son is given"
"With the government upon His shoulders"
"Administration of Order, Judgement and Justice"
"Breaking down the middle wall of partition"
""
"As boys become men and girls women,"
"Remember the manger-born King"
"Whose birth and life frees us from that tyranny-led regime"
"Yes, we remember the immaculate conception of a love-being"
"Who changed our season once and for all"
"Remember, beloved, remember"
"We celebrate a moment in history"
"When LOVE CAME DOWN"
