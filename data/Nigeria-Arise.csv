"My name is Nigeria,"
"I was born sixty and three years ago"
"By the divine orchestration of Agbanilagbatan."
"Where children my age were used to having two parents, I had three."
"For you see Agbanilagbatan was multifaceted"
"3-in-1."
"I lacked nothing for I was resplendent with resources and a divine heritage."
""
"My birth was so strange yet majestic."
"I was born aged and with knowledge;"
"I knew my Parents had wrestled for my freedom,"
"Freedom from things and people who wanted me for my value."
"Freedom from things and people who assumed possessing me was their birthright."
"Freedom from myself because I didn't even know I was enslaved."
""
"So you see, I was born aged."
"My early days started like an old woman bent over a walking stick,"
"Wise beyond her age, yet unable to speak because I had lost all my teeth;"
"So many ideas but unable to pen them down because like Parkinson, my body was frequently wrecked with tremors."
""
"As the years wound down,"
"I became younger."
"My youth radiant in the glory of God,"
"He had a plan, you see."
"For Nigeria is as the Curious Case of Benjamin Button"
"You'd think having being born aged, I'd only depreciate with each passing year"
"NOT SO!"
""
"Tarry with me,"
"I have a destiny."
"Let me reintroduce myself"
"I am Nigeria of the lineage of El Elyon"
"First of my kind"
"The giant of Africa after the order of the Lion of the Tribe of Judah"
"I am a nation dark with fertility"
"See the horses on my coat of arms?"
"A sign to prove I am at all times destined and worthy of honour for the dignity that flows through my veins."
""
"For you see, my destiny  precedes me."
"I am Unity and faith"
"I am Peace and progress"
"So the enemy fights"
"O how he fights a bloody war"
"At all times seeking to make me a public spectacle"
"And for the life of me, I am shamed in different spheres"
"An embarrassment to many"
"So bad that no one wants to associate with me"
"They take to their heels"
"Seeking asylum in nations spoiled in a sense and nations unknown"
""
"I am"
"Beaten"
"Broken"
"Battered"
"I am"
"Exploited"
"Exposed"
"An eyesore"
"I am bereft"
"Blood on my hands but not mine nor of my making"
"I am dead."
""
"Where is my youth?"
"Where is my light?"
"Agbanilagbatan!"
"Why have you hidden your face from me?"
"Restorer of my lost glory,"
"Do You desert me too as my kinsmen and kinswomen do?"
"Why are You silent?"
"Where is my multifaceted progenitor?"
""
"Stop right there"
"Or have you forgotten,"
"That like the Curious Case of Benjamin Button, so I am."
"Have you forgotten, that because I have a glorious destiny,"
"Every thing and every vice available for the one who hates God"
"Are constantly being thrown my way to sway and hurt me."
""
"What they don't know is"
"As the years wind down, I become youthful"
"I am a meager of the mistakes of the past, the future of Nigeria"
"I am a prophecy that has been fulfilled"
"I am a prophecy that is being fulfilled"
"And my youth is eternal!"
""
"Come come come"
"Those who belong to Nigeria"
"Do you remember The Pledge?"
""
"""I pledge to Nigeria my country."
"To be faithful, loyal and honest."
"To serve Nigeria with all my strength."
"To defend her unity, and uphold her honour and glory."
"So help me God."""
""
"My name is Nigeria"
"I ARISE!"
"I stand by the power of the Holy Ghost,"
"Who dares make war with God's chosen and wins?"
"No one in history has"
"No one in history ever will."
