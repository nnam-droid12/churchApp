"We were fine in our mess!"
"Or so we thought..."
"Drinking effluent for water,"
"Ravishing sludge for food,"
"We had rags for clothing,"
"We sang and danced to dirge as though it were an anthem of peace and satisfaction."
"We were fine in our mess,"
"Or so we thought."
"It was all a facade,"
"Yet we were too blind to see,"
"Too deaf to hear,"
"Too dead to discern."
""
"Strolled in Mr. Busy-Body,"
"He just wouldn't mind His business!"
"His eyes so tender,"
"His gaze far reaching,"
"He had an electric effect to His voice."
""
"On and on and on, He went,"
"Speaking to us about what it means to live,"
"Showing us what it means to love, and to be loved,"
"Illuminating a darkness we didn't know ran deep in us."
""
"Mr. Busy-Body,"
"How our own take join Your own?"
"I mean, why are You so concerned about us?"
""
"Mr. Busy-Body,"
"How MY own take join Your own?"
"I mean, why are You so concerned about ME?"
""
"Don't answer that,"
"You had me at ""Hello"", Jesus!"
""
"Who can disregard the depth of Your love and care?"
"What weight of worries should I give room to overshadow Your presence which envelopes me like a blanket?"
"Why should I let go of this precious eternal reality for ephemeral events that pinch me so?"
""
"Yes, ephemeral legitimate events."
"Brother, don't be fazed, your redemption was sealed, stamped, verified by the blood of the Lamb."
"You have joy like a river."
"Sister, that pain does not have the capacity to out-live the One You call ""Ancient of Days""."
"You have peace like a river."
""
"Heyyyyy,"
"Have I failed to mention the exact trial you're going through?"
"Hmmmph...."
"... But is it bigger than God's love?"
"Is it something Mr. Busy Body didn't factor in when He hung on the Cross of Calvary because He was (indeed He still is) madly in love with you?"
""
"No, no, no"
"Far be it from you to pretend you can't feel and touch the shakings all around."
"Remember, Mr. Busy Body slept on a pillow in the midst of a nasty storm,"
"He wasn't unaware of that storm."
"Rather, His internal environment was fixated on a reality that transcended the turbulence."
"So no, you don't pretend,"
"You allow His fierce love to take over your being."
""
"The love of God changes everything."
"Your sight,"
"Your understanding,"
"Your entire internal universe,"
"Your external reality."
""
"Make a resolve with me,"
"Say with me,"
"""I will be as unrelenting in trusting God as He is unrelenting in His love for me."""
