"HE NEVER FAILS"
""
""
"It seems like I’ve become overly familiar with the mercies of God I’ve so many times benefited"
"from."
""
""
"There’s a type of forgetfulness familiarity causes,"
"A sense of entitlement does it beget,"
"And then I’m unable to see the goodness of God."
"God forbid that the taste of forgetfulness settles on me!"
"So, yes, I yield my mind to remember."
""
""
"God. Never. Failed."
"Tonight, I lift the cloak of forgetfulness."
"I remember being plagued term in, term out with school fees unpaid."
"I remember being sent home in the glare of the afternoon sun,"
"My mates with wondering stares that said, “Again?”"
"I remember tears from being so embarrassed,"
"I remember being so angry at everything and everyone."
""
""
"Guess what?"
"I also remember being recipient of gifts during several prize giving events."
"I also remember representing my school in competitions."
"Again, I remember being selected for leadership roles despite of the spite."
""
""
"Or was it when my Head of Department left his desk,"
"Trekked a long distance to the ATM to get his cash for my fees"
"He said it was a loan, but like Jesus, he never called it such nor recognized it as a debt."
"Friends, I have seen God in the flesh severally."
"I don’t have time’s permission to share it all,"
"But boy do I remember."
"God forbid that I forget when other goings get tough!"
"I remember, O how I remember!"
""
""
"God. Never. Fails."
"I have been marred by several circumstances."
"Maybe for you, it’s dealing with hurt and abandonment."
"Maybe for you, it’s that lying voice that keeps whispering loudly,"
"“Your life is worth nothing, just end it now.”"
""
""
"Hey sister!"
"Shut that down!"
"Life is not a bed of roses but you have the Rose of Sharon on your side;"
"He is able to restore and save."
"Stop making comparisons with people’s lives projected on a screen,"
"You have wealth on your inside!"
"It’s an abundant ocean of security, stability and rest."
""
""
"Hey brother, yes you"
"So your colleagues are “taking glory” for your ideas and diligence;"
"You’ve been passed up for promotion more times than you can count,"
"What hope is there?"
"Why do these never-ending doubts keep pounding on this door sure to give way soon?"
"I don’t have an answer, but I have a question,"
"What do you remember?"
""
""
"This world is a battle field for men who love the Lord!"
"Times and seasons happen to all men, including kings,"
"It happened to Jesus as He walked the face of the earth too."
"Don’t you worry, we war differently,"
"We expire haste and mago-mago"
"A wise man by the Spirit once said,"
"“Those that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength and soar on the wings of eagles”"
""
""
"Elohim Shomri - The Lord who protects"
"He is on the scene being played"
"He is NOW"
"Inside of His embrace, can you settle and see that He doesn’t fail."
""
""
"What do you remember?"
"It’s your story to tell,"
"It’s your blessing to count,"
"There’s a life to live again."
