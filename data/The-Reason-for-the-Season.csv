"Then..."
""
"I remember the yesteryears"
"Some two decades ago,"
"Happily trotting down dusty paths"
"Knowing fully well that the trip would be rewarded"
"Food basket in hand"
"Heading for our next door neighbour"
"""Merry Christmas ma!"""
""
"The sound of carols from old stereos,"
"Miniature pieces of well-pressed clothings floating,"
"-A few tear-stained cheeks fresh out of ""Fada"" Christmas' arms,"
"-All, with joy, clutching goodie bags."
"The daring ones with cameras zeroed in on their faces,"
"Spilling rehearsed Yuletide greetings to daddies, mommies, uncles, aunties, friends."
"Day well spent!"
""
"Now..."
""
"Boys have become men"
"The girls are now women"
"See, we remember the manger-born King"
"Whose birth and life frees us from that tyranny-led regime."
"Yes, we remember the immaculate conception of a Love-being,"
"Who changed our season once and for all."
"We remember the reason for season!"
""
""
"A Child who shouldered an enormous responsibility"
"Of illuminating our darkness"
"Of bringing joy to our dreary world"
"Of reconciling the prodigals to the One"
"Of teaching our stoppered hearts to ring again"
"The REDs we see, of redemption!"
"The GREENs we embrace, of life eternal!!"
""
"How loudly this Child's birth pounds on every heart!"
"This is the sound we respond to with reckless abandon:"
"To give as we were given"
"To love as we are loved"
"To herald many just as we have been called"
"To proclaim the Christ!"
"King of righteousness!!"
