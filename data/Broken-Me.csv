"""Oh take heart darling,"
I also know this pain you speak of.
"Just last week, I also ..."""
On and on she carried on talking.
"The summary of it all seemed to say,"
"""We've also been there, so chin up""."

"I thought I could share my load,"
Unburden for some kind of relief
"But here I am, not any better."
Yesterday's conquered addictions now loudly seek my attention.
"They ramble on and on saying,"
"""Come, no one understands."
"Come, there's relief in us."
"Come."""

I could see a cloak of hopelessness slowly descending into my atmosphere
Unhealthy rhetorical questions invading my mind
"""Are you certain your God still heals?"""
"""Wouldn't you just curse God and let go?"""
"""Have you forgotten you've had just 2 breakthroughs in the past 5 years?"""
"""What exactly are you still holding on for?"""

I say SHUSH!
Out of my thoughts
You have no audience here.
SHUSH!

"Look at this bloody Cross,"
Whose Blood is it painted with?
And for whom was this Blood shed?

Did you hear of His broken bones?
"You couldn't have, because NOT A BONE OF HIM WAS BROKEN."
"By virtue of this fulfillment of Scripture,"
"He swallowed up and mended my broken heart, broken body and seemingly broken dreams."

"Oh Abba,"
Many are those who make mockery of my trust in You.
But though these trials be unstoppered and my cry be broken;
Though this pain be so tangible
"And though my body be sickly,"
I will yet cling to the horns of the altar.
"Ye, through the darkest of valleys, I will embrace Your rod and Your staff."
"Without doubt, I know, in being fettered to You, victory is certain!"

Miracles are forged in broken places
You answer the cry of the broken.
