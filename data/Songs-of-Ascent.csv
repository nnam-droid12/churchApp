"God too has burdens???"

"Yes,"
"Against you are lying lips,"
"Sharp darts of the enemy,"
"Blood thirsty men of war"
"But can you resolve not to crumble under the pressure of life?"

"You ask how -"
"When your strength is expired,"
"When you enter into the rest of the Lord,"
"When you yield to the release of His abundant grace,"
"When you surrender to the Refiner’s fire,"
"Then, you boldly join in with the saints to sing the song of ascendency!"
