"How do we begin to describe the holiness of God?"
"Absolute purity and light"
"Words fail"
"But by the power of the Holy Spirit"
"A consciousness dawns on our hearts"
"Turn your hearts over to the Spirit"
"Delve in and pull today"
"Okon mi fo, Kiji kiji"
"Before the king of kings we stand"
"Bent over in awestruck wonder"
"Holy"
"Holy"
"Holy are You Lord!"
